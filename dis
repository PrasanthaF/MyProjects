Good afternoon,

Thank you. I do not need extensive medical documentation. The documentation that I would need is a licensed medical provider making a recommendation that you work from home, the amount of days per week you will need to work from home, and the recommended duration you will need the accommodation. The duration can be permanent, but they need to give us a time frame for the need.
Whatever you have that meets that requirements, please forward to me by fax or email. If it does not meet that requirement, please use the previously attached forms or supply a medical note that would make the needed recommendations. Please let me know if there are any questions or concerns. 


Kind regards,
Alicia Miller
